# HTTPMethods

we will learn how to handle HTTP methods, such as GET and POST in Flask using Python. Here, we will understand the concept of HTTP, GET, and HTTP POST, and then we will the example and implement each in Flask. Before starting letâ€™s understand the basic terminology:

GET: to request data from the server.
POST: to submit data to be processed to the server.
PUT: A PUT request is used to modify the data on the server. It replaces the entire content at a particular location with data that is passed in the body payload. If there are no resources that match the request, it will generate one.
PATCH: PATCH is similar to a PUT request, but the only difference is, it modifies a part of the data. It will only replace the content that you want to update.
DELETE: A DELETE request is used to delete the data on the server at a specified location.
